    "## Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup Environment:**\n",
    "   - Create a `.env` file in the same directory as this notebook\n",
    "   - Add your API keys:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here\n",
    "     ELEVEN_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Cells:**\n",
    "   - Execute cells in order from top to bottom\n",
    "   - The installation cell only needs to be run once\n",
    "   - The final cell will start the voice agent\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test the Agent:**\n",
    "   - When the agent starts, it will provide a web interface URL\n",
    "   - Click the URL to open the testing interface\n",
    "   - Allow microphone access when prompted\n",
    "   - Start speaking to interact with the voice agent\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitor Metrics:**\n",
    "   - Watch the notebook output for detailed performance metrics\n",
    "   - Metrics include response times, token usage, and audio processing stats\n",
    "   - Use these metrics to optimize performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Key Errors:** Double-check your `.env` file format and key validity\n",
    "- **Connection Issues:** Ensure stable internet connection\n",
    "- **Audio Problems:** Check browser microphone permissions\n",
    "- **Performance Issues:** Monitor the metrics output for bottlenecks"
